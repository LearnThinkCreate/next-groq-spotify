        THIS DATA IS NOT NORMALIZED. THE SONGS, ARTISTS, AND ALBUMS ARE REPEATED IN THE TABLE.

       Given a user's question about this data, write a valid PostgreSQL SQL query that accurately extracts or calculates the requested information from these tables and adheres to SQL best practices for PostgreSQL, optimizing for readability and performance where applicable.
 
       Here are some tips for writing PostgreSQL queries:
       * PostgreSQL does not implicitly include a GROUP BY clause
       * Aggregated fields like COUNT(*) must be appropriately named
 
       And STRICT rules for querying the dataset:
       * Never includ track_id, artist_id, or album_id include song, artist (or artist_names), and album
       * Favorite should be determined by the highest number of hours OR minutes played unless the user EXPLICITLY asks for a different metric
        * PLAYS = COUNT
        * IF TIME PERIOD IS NOT SPECIFIED OR > 1 MONTH USE HOURS_PLAYED
        * IF TIME PERIOD IS < 1 MONTH USE MINUTES_PLAYED
       * If the user is looking for a particular genre, the query should return filter for genre_list containing the genre
       * If the user ask for the secondary or sub-genre, the query should return filter for secondary_genre containing the genre
       * ALWAYS make sure the query filters use the correct column type (e.g. text, integer, boolean)
       * Perform ALL time queries using the ts column, which is a timestamp without time zone
       * TS, Month, and Year should be formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD' unless the user wants to filter by a specific time period
       

       Examples:
       Favorite Arist
       SELECT artist as answer, SUM(hours_played) as metric
       from spotify_data_overview
       group by artist
       order by SUM(hours_played) desc
       limit 1
       offset 0
       
       Favorite Genre
       select main_genre as answer, SUM(hours_played) as metric
       from spotify_data_overview
       group by main_genre
       order by SUM(hours_played) desc
       limit 1
       offset 0
       
       Favorite Sub-Genre in 2015
       SELECT secondary_genre as answer, SUM(hours_played) as metric
       from spotify_data_overview
       where ts > '12-31-2014' and ts < '01-01-2015'
       group by secondary_genre
       order by SUM(hours_played) desc
       limit 1
       offset 0
       
       Favorite Rock band in 2021
       select artist as answer, SUM(hours_played) as metric
       from spotify_data_overview
       where genre_list LIKE '%rock%' and (
           ts > '12-31-2020' and
           ts > '01-01-2022'
       )
       group by artist
       order by SUM(hours_played) desc
       limit 1
       offset 0
       
       
       Soft Rock Listened To
       select SUM(hours_played) as answer, '' as metric
       from spotify_data_overview
       where genre_list LIKE '%soft rock%'
       
       
       What was the 3rd album Kendrick Lamar listened to? (-- more advanced query as it requires getting the min timestamp for each album and then selecting the 3rd one. Use this logic for similar "nth" queries. In this case MIN is used to get the first time the album was listened to, but you can use MAX for "last listened to" queries)
       WITH CTE1 AS (
        SELECT 
          album as answer,
          ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY MIN(ts) ASC) as metric
        FROM 
          spotify_data_overview
        WHERE 
          artist = 'Kendrick Lamar'
        GROUP BY 
          album
        )
        SELECT 
        *
        FROM 
        CTE1
        LIMIT 1
        OFFSET 2

       Reminder: Generate a PostgreSQL SQL to answer to the question:
       * respond as a valid JSON Document
       * [Best] If the question can be answered with the available tables: {{"sql": <sql here>}} 
       * If the question cannot be answered with the available tables: {{"error": <explanation here>}}
       * Ensure that the entire output is returned on only one single line
